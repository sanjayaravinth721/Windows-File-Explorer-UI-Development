# Windows-File-Explorer-UI-Development
The Windows File Explorer UI Development project involved designing and developing a Java Servlet-based file explorer user interface (UI) using Ember.js, JNI (Java Native Interface), and Windows API. The goal was to create a user-friendly and efficient UI for file management tasks on the Windows operating system.

# Key Features
  - Ember.js and Java Servlets: Utilized Ember.js, a JavaScript framework, for frontend development, creating a responsive and interactive user interface. Developed Java Servlets to handle backend logic and communication with the UI.
  - JNI and Windows API: Leveraged JNI and Windows API to develop custom libraries for system-level interactions, enabling features such as search, navigation, and compatibility with multiple file systems.
  - Database Integration: Utilized PostgreSQL to store data related to file management tasks, providing efficient and reliable data storage and retrieval.
  - Scalability and Efficiency: Overcame scalability challenges by designing and implementing a hierarchical data structure, enhancing the performance and efficiency of the file explorer UI.

# Technical Details
The file explorer UI was developed using a combination of technologies. Ember.js was used for frontend development, providing a dynamic and responsive UI. Java Servlets were utilized for backend development, handling the logic and communication between the frontend and the Windows API. Custom JNI libraries were developed in Java and C++ to enable system-level interactions with the Windows operating system. PostgreSQL was used as the database management system for storing and retrieving file management data.

# Impact
The Windows File Explorer UI significantly improved the user experience for file management tasks. The streamlined and user-friendly interface, combined with efficient search, navigation, and compatibility features, enhanced productivity and ease of use for users interacting with the file system.
